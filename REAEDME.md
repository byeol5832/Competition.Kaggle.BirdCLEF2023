## Goal of the Competition

Birds are excellent indicators of biodiversity change since they are highly mobile and have diverse habitat requirements. Changes in species assemblage and the number of birds can thus indicate the success or failure of a restoration project. However, frequently conducting traditional observer-based bird biodiversity surveys over large areas is expensive and logistically challenging. In comparison, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) combined with new analytical tools based on machine learning allows conservationists to sample much greater spatial scales with higher temporal resolution and explore the relationship between restoration interventions and biodiversity in depth.

For this competition, you'll use your machine-learning skills to identify Eastern African bird species by sound. Specifically, you'll develop computational solutions to process continuous audio data and recognize the species by their calls. The best entries will be able to train reliable classifiers with limited training data. If successful, you'll help advance ongoing efforts to protect avian biodiversity in Africa, including those led by the Kenyan conservation organization NATURAL STATE.

### ðŸ’¡Getting Started Notebook

To get started quickly, we made this starter notebook that generates a submission using the new Bird Vocalization Classifier model. It was recently open-sourced by the Google Research team on Kaggle Models.
